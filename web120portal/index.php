 <p>My name is James, and I am 4.9% Neanderthal.  I am not allergic to dark chocolate; as a matter of fact, I rather enjoy it.  When I look at the sun, or near it, I sneeze.  I read somewhere that this is because there is a nerve called the 'trigeminal nerve' that runs near some ocular nerves, and when this trigeminal nerve is stimulated by the sun (photons from the sun, rather) it can fire unwantedly, but understandably (it is only doing what it knows how to do, after all, much like a bumblebee digging a burrow), resulting in a sneeze.  I remember the term, 'trigeminal' by thinking of my friend Michael, my friend Jeff and myself (because we were all born under the astrological sign Gemini) all hugging each other and laughing at some unscrupulous yet well timed joke.  This memory makes me feel warm, and that is often a good way to feel, relative to not warm. I enjoy ice skating and finger nail painting, sometimes simultaneously.</p>
