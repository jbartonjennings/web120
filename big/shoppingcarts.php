<p>As of early 2019, it appears that many small online retailers choose from a relatively small set of shopping cart software programs. Based on my research, it appears that Shopify is likely the most popular choice at this point in time. More comprehensive small-business platforms such as Wix and Squarespace do seem to be gaining in popularity. In particular, the e-commerce functions of Wix seems to be highly regarded. </p>
<div>
<p>When choosing a platform, several key considerations come into play:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Price Structure: each option seems to have devised a unique way of monetizing their service. Some brands charge a fee for every transaction in your online store. Others charge by bandwidth used or the number of products offered on the site. A comprehensive analysis of each program under consideration would be essential before selecting a service, since the most cost effective program is likely to be dependent on the type of store being launched.</li>
        <li>Specialization: due to the variety of goods and services offered online, it seems that e-commerce brands specialize in different corners of the market. Some programs are targeted more directly at businesses selling physical wares, while others are targeted at businesses selling downloads, classes or services. Picking a program that suits the sector of the market you are entering is likely to make the project more successful.</li>
        <li>Integration: It is particularly important that the software integrates seamlessly into existing webpages.</li>
    </ul>
