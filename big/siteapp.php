<p>While some projects may necessitate both a responsive web design and a mobile app, it is important to make development decisions based on the specific needs of each client or business. Mobile applications and responsive websites have much overlapping functionality, but there are key differences that make them more or less appropriate for a given context. </p>
<p>Responsive Websites: Since nearly any business will require or already have in place a website, adding responsive elements is the fastest and least expensive way to engage with the mobile landscape. Responsive websites have several advantages: First, the sites can be accessed immediately, without the need to download and install software; Second, the sites are inherently compatible for all devices since they have been created to work on all available browsers; Third, websites are fast and easy to upgrade and support; Fourth, given their ubiquity on the web, they are generally easier to find and accessible to a wider audience. However, websites are weak in several respects: Offline accessibility, sites (unless cached) are not generally available if the device is not connected to the internet (a crucial consideration for less developed areas with more sparse connectability options); User Experience, a website is generally slower and more limited in content and functionality on a mobile device; Monetization, access to websites cannot be purchased through the device’s app store, limiting options for making money from mobile customers. 
</p>
<p>Mobile Applications: Mobile applications can be created as native or hybrid technologies. While hybrid applications can be used across an array of operating systems, native applications are platform-specific. Development costs for hybrid apps may be lower, but functionality may be more limited and support costs may be higher than native apps. Mobile applications have several advantages over websites: First, content is often downloaded to the device, enabling faster response times and accessibility even when the device is not connected to the internet; Second, applications can integrate more effectively into the operating system of the device, allowing for seamless connections to GPS, cameras and other built-in functionality; Third, the user experience in using an application is generally better since the program has been designed specifically for that context; Fourth, mobile applications are easier to monetize, since customers can be charged to download and access them.
